## Introduction
I was born from Toronto,Ontario. 
I moved to Los Angeles In 2016. 
During my high school years up until 2020 I was in competitive swimming.
My goal of becoming an Olympian failed when the pandemic stopped practices and cancelled my final high school swim meet. 
Now I am in UCSD as a Junior studying Computer Science trying to get jacked by lifting weights.
A picture of me as a kid in Canada:

## Programming
As a programmer my favorite language is python. 
I developed progams for a company which would "steal" a bunch of information from other websites by webscraping. 
I did not get paid because my dad forced me to make these programs for him so that part of his job would be automated. 
Quoting my dad:
>This work is very important for you.

If you ever wanted to learn webscraping on python use these two lines below to download some of my favorite modules:
`pip install selenium`
`pip install beautifulsoup4`
Also I learned webscraping on [dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-python-using-beautiful-soup/).
Currently I have knowledge in
-python
-java
-C
-C++
-github
-vim
-Arm

The face is because I am breathing and I am the one in the lead :).

## Goals
So for the last 300 days I decided to not have/act upon any goals. 
I have though of some on the spot and put them in a task list:
- [ ] become jacked
- [ ] regain my 7 pack
- [ ] get 6 figure salary
- [x] grow to 6 ft
- [ ] have a successful business/side hustle
- [ ] design/get a tattoo

The only one completed so far was the one I didn't work for.

## [Bench Squat Deadlift](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/teen-derek2.htm)
Currently the program I am doing for lifting weights relys heavily on these 3 compound lifts.
My highest weight lifted is 240 on deadlift. Here is [Picture Proof](IMG-0210.jpg)
